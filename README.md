##Resources

###[Google's Tensorflow mooc](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730/lessons/6370362152/concepts/63798118150923)
This is a deep learning mooc by google that uses tensorflow. It does seem to cover a lot of foundational topics in DL and consequently NNs. It covers the two main topics I am (and presumably we all are) interested in: RNNs for sequential data, and CNNs for image data. They present it as a very hands-on approach, with Ipython NB assignments, and practical training in how to use Tensorflow. 
The main problem with this is that it may be a little too basic.

### [Stanford Computer Vision ](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)
This is an undergrad class on computer vision that revolves mostly around current practices and foundations of CNNs. They have all the resources online (notes + slides + assigments), which are all well-written and easy to pick up. The assignments are nice ipython NBs that guide you through the problems (which to me is the sign of good assigments).
The main problem with this is that this is mostly focused on computer vision as an application of ML and NNs, however I think that we'll be able to translate anything we learn here to applications that are of interest to us easily.

###[Stanford  Deep Learning for NLP](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/index.html)
This is the same as computer vision but for text analysis. It goes through applications of deep learning to NLP, as well as some foundations of DL  and NNs itself. It's all nicely available and self-contained much like the CV class. 

***

###[Bishop ML]
THE book on theoretical ML. We'll be getting our math from here. 

***

###[UFLDL](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial)
THE tutorial on deep learning. Was once a class at Stanford, not it's a publicly editable wiki. 


***

###[Geoff Hinton's Coursera Class](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001)
Good class that covers a lot of topics with a good degree of depth. There are notes and assignments.  One downside is that they use matlab (octave).

###[Deep Learning From The Bottom Up](http://www.metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/deep_learning)
This is a roadmap on [Metacademy](http://www.metacademy.org/) (if you don't know of this website have a look, it's amazing). It outlines the main topics involved in deep learning and NNs, every link on the document redirects to a list of topics and resources for learning that subject.

###[Yann Le Cunn's NYU Course](http://cilvr.cs.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=deeplearning:slides:start#week_1)
The man himself teaches a deep learning course at NYU. Slides, assignments and some lecture videos are available.

##Organization
We will read some chapters from the Bishop Book every week and meet once a week on Friday and discuss the readings.

##Projects/Practice
We should come up with some project ideas that we can apply what we learn to.  If we want to practice, some of the moocs above have nice Ipython notebook assignments that seem straightforward. 

##Which Library?
So most of these resources use Tensorflow, which I'd be ok with learning. Alternatives are theano or torch. I have no strong preference, Tensorflow seems the most convenient because most of the material in the resource list depends on it.
